## 1. Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE)

Illinois uses a **dual-threshold BBCE** system based on whether the household contains a "Qualifying Member" (QM). A QM is a person who is elderly (60+) or disabled.

| Household Type | Gross Income Limit | Asset Limit |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| No QM | **165% FPL** | **$3,000** |
| With QM | **200% FPL** | **$4,500** |

All households must still pass the **100% FPL net income test**.
